Hi, I'm April.

Are you hungry? Get a snack, then hang out and read a while. If there's a song attached to a post, give it a try. You might like it. Or not.

turtlemadness isn't about anything in particular, but you can probably expect to find the following things here:

- Reviews of things, mostly media
- Japanese media exports, like anime, music, and manga
- Reflections on how any given day was
- Thoughts on management, work, and business
- 少し日本語。多分。

I started turtlemadness back in high school, and it's lived on in one form or another ever since. As the description says, sometimes it's nice to just have somewhere to write.
