Hi, I'm April. I like going outside to hike, bike, and backpack. When I'm inside, I'll make tea and read (or write), and I work as an engineering manager with a focus on reliability engineering. My favorite foods are often spicy and sometimes fried.

Are you hungry too? Get a snack, then hang out and read a while.

My journal isn't about anything in particular, but you can probably expect to find the following things here:

- Reviews of things, mostly media
- Japanese media exports, like anime, music, and manga
- Reflections on how any given day was
- Thoughts on management, work, and business
- 少し日本語。多分。
