Android is so good at supporting external hardware. I got this nifty little RGB keyboard for around the house, and realized I could plug it in to my tablet pretty easily. So now, I’m sitting at the coffee table and typing this up. It’s a nice change of pace.

Since I use tumblr as my platform (for now, anyway…) they bugged me to install the app once I logged in. Makes sense, and I don’t usually like apps, but for composing text it seemed like a good enough idea to try. So…I install it, and I go to write a post, and of course my Yoga Pro 10 is in landscape mode, and of course, _the app switches to portrait mode._ “Oh! You’re writing, using the app? Let me go ahead and disrespect whatever setting you’re using, because I know better than you!” Naw, man! I’ll poke around online for a few minutes and look into it, but I’m really not into that so it might get uninstalled right away.

At any rate, the general Android experience with a keyboard is _Pretty Good,_ and I could see myself using an external keyboard for writing or general navigation with some regularity. I dunno, I guess it’s a bit nicer and less distracting than the&nbsp;laptop?&nbsp;

Other than that, we left work around 6, got a bunch of groceries, and finally made it home around 8. I don’t think we had dinner until 8:30, so I’ll probably be up for a little while yet as I digest (both dinner and the day itself!) which has me kinda thinking about what to unwind with. I finished Beyond the Boundary this past weekend, and it was a good little trip. I generally like 12-episode anime, especially when they’re an original series. The story writers can usually put something good together in that kind of time. I’m pretty sure I went over it in my _Usagi Drop_ mega-essay, but adaptations can often feel rushed, heavily condensed, or can’t figure out how to end 12 or 13 volumes of manga in 12 episodes. So, an original series is always a treat.

On the music front, aside from the extra helping of SHISHAMO, I came across a Yunomi album on Google Music that I hadn’t really dug into. The titular song (大江戸コントローラー _Oedo Controller_) I’d certainly heard before, but there were a handful of other songs and a few TORIENA remixes that aren’t available on bandcamp. The whole thing is really good, so give it a try if you’re into kawaii sounds. Yunomi is a good all-season artist, but I feel like they shine brightest in the colder, darker fall and winter days. I mean, it’s already mid-August! I’m hoping to buy a kotatsu once the weather cools down since my loft area doesn’t really get too much heat and we try to keep the thermostat down. But…it’s usually too cold. I think it’d solve a few problems, having a little working space like that.

Then again, it’s still August, and too hot to think about what it’ll take to stay warm. I’m always okay with a bit more summer…
