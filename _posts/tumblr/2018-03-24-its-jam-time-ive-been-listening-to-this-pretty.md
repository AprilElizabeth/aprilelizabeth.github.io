it’s jam time

I’ve been listening to this pretty much on repeat for the past week, it’s just such a jam. I don’t really…have a better word for it. I’ve been poking around bandcamp looking for more stuff I like, and they made it especially easy by publishing an article about&nbsp;[“Eight Kawaii Artists Using Grotesque Sounds to Redefine “Cute” Japanese Music.”](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/03/23/kawaii-japanese-electronic-feature/)&nbsp;

I’d been listening to a kawaii radio station on youtube, but always felt kinda bad. I have no idea how the artists were compensated. I really liked what I was hearing, and wanted to support it! At least, the station attributes all the songs so it’s pretty easy to go looking. And, what’s amazing is all these artists pretty much just release stuff online for free. But, with stuff like bandcamp, you get the option to actually buy it. And that makes me feel pretty good.

So it exists in this weird and interesting world where, it’s totally free to listen to. I’m guessing there’s like zero mandatory compensation (except maybe through YT Red or ads?) and that is absolutely magical! It has introduced a new problem, though. It’s a little difficult to manage a kind of disparate music collection like this. Google Music is pretty good for general streaming, so I could pretty easily just dump all my purchases there and then they’re automatically synced everywhere, which is pretty nice. Otherwise, it’s back to the old days of installing VLC everywhere and copying files around manually.

bandcamp doesn’t help this with FLAC downloads. A single album I have is 426MB. It’s not an insane amount of space, I guess. Plus, there’s streaming. But I’d like to manage playlists and all that, and it’d be great if it were mobile. I don’t mind having the files stored locally, either. I have the play store open in another tab, maybe there’s something there…

I planned a long weekend for myself, which will be good. We did some general loafing but also some chores today, tomorrow I’ll be cleaning the house, then my X1 arrives on Monday. I’ll spend the day working on it, then test drive it at the datacenter on Tuesday. Exciting stuff!

I might have a good lead on an app I used a long time ago called doubleTwist. Apparently they have a cloud player which does FLAC, it’ll just stream from Google Drive. That might be worth checking out…so, I’m gonna go do that now. While listening to [Yunomi](https://iamyunomi.bandcamp.com/album/--2).
