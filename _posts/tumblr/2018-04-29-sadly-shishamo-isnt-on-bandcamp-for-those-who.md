Sadly, SHISHAMO isn’t on bandcamp. For those who haven’t bought the discography, there’s not much to do but Google Music and YouTube. Spotify, too. I wanted to share Natsu no Koibito (My Summer Love)&nbsp;‘cause it’s almost summer. Though it’s more of a end-of-summer kind of song, it had the right feeling. Take care not to cry too hard at the acapallea solo around 4:15, though.
