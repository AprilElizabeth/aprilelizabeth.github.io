give or take

keep in mind, i just started. and i’ve accomplished the following:

- learned a lot about the build infrastructure  
- better understood lvms and xen project
- wrote 1 regex and 1 little shell script to help automate my workflow
- finished up rebuilding a QA environment
- participated in a maintenance and actually helped deploy a production service
- physically brought a server back up in the datacenter
- assisted my team in tracking down and fixing their workflow issues

i think it is easy to be like&nbsp;“oh my god, i should be doing more” but in reality, for two weeks in, i am getting things done and feeling helpful. the team seems to agree. there is definitely some imposter syndrome going on, i am trying to remember that image that explains what’s actually happening. doesn’t help that i sit next to two of the most long-term developers…!

so, hopefully i can look back on this in 50 weeks, and say&nbsp;“wow! look at how much progress you’ve made! remember when you were freaking out a little bit!? how you like me now?”

etc.

additionally, i’ll need to import this to the new turtlemadness. eventually.
