Certainly it’s been a good while, right? Someone asked me what&nbsp;‘turtle madness’ is. Valid question.

I spent the better part of the afternoon running down a network issue. I have a hypervisor with access to various subnets, including the DHCP server’s home. At least, on my side. I don’t manage the network, and that’s generally pretty OK. I found out, the HVM wasn’t configured the same as its friends, the whole thing was kind of a one-off. In fact, I don’t think it’s in configuration management.

The nail that sticks up gets hammered down. I will restore order.

I did get to learn about bonding and VLAN tagging management on the server, though. The network admin popped in and reconfigured the port, getting me back on track. Once `ip a` returned what I was looking for (bond up, bridge up – instead of down/unknown!) we were on our way…

Otherwise things are pretty nice. I have a good lot of work ahead of me, including some hardware work which I look forward to. I’d like to get out ahead of some of my task work so I can get on to a planning project. I think I’ll be able to do that in not too long, actually. I’d really like my computer to ship, too. I’m not sure what I’ll do with my Surface. Once I have a Linux-based daily driver, I might sell it or just keep it around to play with. Selling it is the smart move, but I don’t specifically HAVE to. If I’m going all-Linux, it seems only right to ditch the last Microsoft device, right?

I was thinking about it, after converting my desktop. Why even bother? But, as long as it’s my job to be good at Linux, well, I should probably be good at Linux. Also, it just feels better. It might limit my gaming a bit (and yes, I did save one of 3 drives to install Windows and formatted the big storage drive as exFAT for shared access…) but that’s not bad! Maybe instead of games, I’ll, I dunno, _write?_&nbsp;which seems pretty good. After a co-worker shared a blog post they wrote (and complimented my writing, oh gosh) it felt like a good idea.

But, it’s a lot harder, writing personal stuff instead of work stuff. Work stuff and tech writing comes really easy. And whenever I do pick it up again (or anything really) I feel like my first place to go is getting meta with it. I’m writing about whatever activity I’m up to. I’m writing about writing. When I hopped on Lang-8 after a while, I wrote about writing a diary. Almost like I enjoy writing about how it works and what I’m doing versus anything of more substance. I guess that’s why I wanted to include the bit about the hypervisor?

Sometimes I like to write about stuff, though. If you follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/heyspinachbaby) at all, you know I’m a huge goddamn anime nerd, and right now, especially for Yuru Camp (Laid Back Camp). Because it’s coziest fucking show _ever._&nbsp;More cozy than Flying Witch. And _that_&nbsp;show was a fuzzy blanket on a winter’s day. EXCEPT YURU CAMP IS LITERALLY A WARM BLANKET ON A WINTER’S DAY WTH. I mean, do you see this shit? Marvel crossover meme time:

So, go watch it. Meanwhile, I’m gonna go check my domain via the CenturyLink PTAP App since I can’t seem to reach it from home. Oh good.
