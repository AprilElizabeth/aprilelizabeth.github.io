Part 2 of a 2-part post on what I've learned as a hiring manager. It's worth spending time on your process.

# Part 2: Interviews

Near as I can tell, interviews are mandatory. Even the most highly recommended candidate or previous employee must be interviewed in the same manner as every other candidate. In truth, I used to dread interviewing - both as a manager and a candidate. I struggled to answer trivia questions, I failed to make a connection, I forgot that the real interview is really the first 90 to 180 days. As good as we like to think we are at hiring, there's just no way you can get a good feel for how someone operates day-to-day in just a few hours. So then, why bother interviewing at all? What can you accomplish and how can you, the manager, accurately evaluate someone for an open position in that time?

*Spoiler alert: you can't.*

Interviews aren't about you. They're about your team and your candidate. No two candidates are alike, and not everyone interviews well. Imagine you had a solid recommendation from someone you trust, but they struggle with your interview process. Would you question the recommendation, the process, or the candidate? Perhaps it's any of the three, but the only part you can control is the process. I think the best you can do is represent your team and your company in the most honest & straightforward way possible. Just like [writing a job listing,]({{site.url}}/2020-10-02/how-i-hire.html) the best candidates will respond to a thoughtful interview process.

Even with a well-planned process & good execution, hiring doesn't always go right. You might make the wrong hire, or let the perfect employee slip past. Mistakes are inevitable, and it's imperative you learn from them to improve your process & as a reminder that evaluation doesn't stop once the offer letter is signed.

Now, how's your calendar looking? Do you have some time to chat? Good, let's get started!

## Communicating with your candidates

In my current position at a mid-market corporation, much of my initial communication is handled through an _Enterprise Recruitment Platform._ Candidates apply or are funneled in via external sources like Linkedin, indeed, or other job aggregators. Their contact information and application materials are made available to me, which allows me to review & screen candidates in the platform and have our internal recruiter reach out to schedule an initial interview. At smaller companies, I was usually in direct contact with candidates. Their applications would reach my inbox directly, and I would handle the scheduling.

Candidates I don't feel are a good fit will usually not receive a reply, which is fine so long as that's made clear in the application process. The most basic rule I have is that any candidate you reach out to or talk with but who isn't selected to move on *must receive a timely response.* Even if you miss out on a good candidate, it's the responsible thing to do. It's not fair to keep people on the hook. If you really wanted them to move on, you would have selected them...and really, what's wrong with reaching out after the fact if you change your mind? Just be open and honest in your discussion.

Unless your organization requires all communication to happen through the recruiter or hiring platform, I suggest reaching out directly via email, call, or even chat. Anything official should happen through official channels - job offers must always be in writing using your organization's required format, for instance. Things like scheduling, follow-ups, and questions are usually fine to handle through other methods, and provide a more comfortable and personal experience. Don't be afraid to answer questions openly and honestly outside of interviews. It can be hard to come up with questions on the spot, so take the time to answer completely, or offer time to chat outside of regular interviews.

It should go without saying, but be professional and consistent in your communications. Let people know what they can expect, when they can expect to hear from you, and provide some kind of deadline for when they should reach out to you if they don't hear back. Being busy isn't an excuse to waste someone's time!
