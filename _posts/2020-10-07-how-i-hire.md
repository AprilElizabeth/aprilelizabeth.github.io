Part 2 of a 2-part post on what I've learned as a hiring manager. It's worth spending time on your process.

# Part 2: Interviews

Near as I can tell, interviews are mandatory. Even the most highly recommended candidate or previous employee must be interviewed in the same manner as every other candidate. In truth, I used to dread interviewing - both as a manager and a candidate. I struggled to answer trivia questions, I failed to make a connection, I forgot that the real interview is really the first 90 to 180 days. As good as we like to think we are at hiring, there's just no way you can get a good feel for how someone operates day-to-day in just a few hours. So then, why bother interviewing at all? What can you accomplish and how can you, the manager, accurately evaluate someone for an open position in that time?

*Spoiler alert: you can't.*

Still, that's okay. Interviews aren't about you. They're about your team and your candidate. No two candidates are alike, and not everyone interviews well. Imagine you had a solid recommendation from someone you trust, but they struggle with your interview process. Would you question the recommendation, the process, or the candidate? Perhaps it's any of the three, but the only part you can control is the process. I think the best you can do is represent your team and your company in the most honest & straightforward way possible. Just like [writing a job listing,]({{site.url}}/2020-10-02/how-i-hire.html) the best candidates will respond to a thoughtful interview process.

Even with a well-planned process & good execution, hiring doesn't always go right. You might make the wrong hire, or let the perfect employee slip past. Mistakes are inevitable learning opportunities you can use to improve your process and as a reminder that evaluation doesn't stop once the offer letter is signed.

Now, how's your calendar looking? Do you have some time to chat? Good, let's get started!

## Communicating with your candidates

In my current position at a mid-market corporation, much of my initial communication is handled through an _Enterprise Recruitment Platform._ Candidates apply or are funneled in via external sources like Linkedin, indeed, or other job aggregators. Their contact information and application materials are made available to me, which allows me to review & screen candidates in the platform and have our internal recruiter reach out to schedule an initial interview. At smaller companies, I was usually the only point of contact with candidates. Their applications would reach my inbox directly, and I would handle the scheduling.

Candidates I don't feel are a good fit will usually not receive a reply, which is fine so long as that's made clear in the application process. The most basic rule I have is that any candidate you reach out to or talk with but who isn't selected to move on *must receive a timely response.* Even if you miss out on a good candidate, it's the responsible thing to do. It's not fair to keep people on the hook. If you really wanted them to move on, you would have selected them...and really, what's wrong with reaching out after the fact if you change your mind? Just be open and honest in your discussion.

Unless your organization requires all communication to happen through the recruiter or hiring platform, I suggest reaching out directly via email, call, or even chat. Anything official should happen through official channels - job offers must always be in writing using your organization's required format, for instance. Things like scheduling, follow-ups, and questions are usually fine to handle through other methods, and provide a more comfortable and personal experience. Don't be afraid to answer questions openly and honestly outside of interviews. It can be hard to come up with questions on the spot, so take the time to respond completely, or offer time to chat outside of regular interviews. Goodness knows, I don't always have a good answer right away. I've found that if you come up with a better answer later and can't shake that feeling, it's best to just reach out and correct yourself. Your candidates will appreciate the transparency!

It should go without saying, but be professional and consistent in your communications. Let people know what they can expect, when they can expect to hear from you, and provide some kind of deadline for when they should reach out to you if they don't hear back. Being busy isn't an excuse to waste someone's time!

### Documentation, and sharing it

I dedicated a section to this in Part 1, but I'll bring it up again because it's very important! As a quick recap, you should document your hiring process in a format suitable for general consumption by:

- Your team (so everyone understands & can contribute to the process)
- Your company (for auditing, compliance, and cross-team collaboration)
- Your candidate (as to set expectations from the outset)

Feel free to use [my hiring documentation]({{site.url}}/assets/post/2020-10-07-how-i-hire/hiring.html) as a starting point!

## Pre-screening

I generally encourage people to apply for a job even if they think they aren't qualified. We craft job listings to the best of our ability, but [impostor syndrome](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/09/02/imposter-syndrome-and-remote-work/) is _real_ and not everyone who is qualified will apply. On the flip side, you might need a good method of handling underqualified candidates or those who aren't exactly interested in what you're looking for. This is where pre-screening comes in. It can take a few forms. You might use one or more of these, but they should happen early on in the hiring process. For example, my company requires a recruiter call first, then after my 1:1 with the candidate, I send along a short questionnaire before scheduling the technical/team interview.

- A short discussion with the candidate. This often takes the form of a recruiter call or a 1:1 between the hiring manager and the candidate. If your team communicates primarily via text/chat, or for accessibility reasons, consider using a text-based platform for better representation on both sides 
- Questionnaires. These may or may not be technical, but like your hiring process overall, you should have a goal in mind. With this, I'm looking for effective written communication skills and how they approach novel problems. There are some opinionated questions as well. Can my candidate disagree respectfully? These (like the entire interview process) are an awful place for trivia questions, but can be kinda fun with questions like "What's the best Linux distribution?" Obviously there's no right answer _(cough Debian cough)_ but it lets a candidate express their opinion or make a case for something.
- Take-home exercises. These are usually things like programming activities or contrived scenarios where the candidate can showcase their skills as they relate to the actual day-to-day work. I once interviewed at Slack for a developer support manager position, where they wanted to know if I could do the job. They provided 5 real-world prompts from customer support issues and enough context to get started, and expected responses as though I'd be replying to a customer. I really liked that exercise, as it put me in the seat of a developer support engineer.
- Reference checks. These usually happen at the end of interviews, but in some situations you might ask for references upfront. There's no hard and fast rule saying you can't reach out to a candidate's references prior to interviewing them, but do be considerate.

## Employer-required interviews

As mentioned, my employer requires a pre-screening call between the recruiter & the candidate. They're usually looking for the basics, like if they've read the description, meet the minimum requirements, explain the benefits, and confirm salary requirements. This takes a small burden off my shoulders, though I usually end up asking some of the same questions. Salary is one of the more important aspects of job negotiation, so I like to ensure the candidate received the right information and can accept the salary range offered.

I've had some cases where I wanted to talk with a pre-screened candidate who was rejected (or self-rejected) after the initial recruiter screen. The recruiter had no problem with this. It's important to understand why the candidate didn't move on, so talk with your recruiter if they didn't advance the candidate before reaching out to the candidate directly.

Other than the recruiter call, I'm not subject to any other employer-required interviews. My engineering organization did have a panel interview made up of other employees from around the company. It was not formally required outside of the engineering org, but it was such a great process that most hiring managers wanted to participate. Of course, your organization might be different. Since you've already planned your interview process, you should have a good understanding of any employer-required interviews.

## Advancing, or not



# The 3 interviews I use, and why

I explained these a little bit in [Part 1,]({{site.url}}/2020-10-02/how-i-hire.html) but only a smidge. Interviewing is time-consuming, and depending on how many candidates you bring in and your interview team size, can also be quite costly. It's certainly a worthwhile investment, and I do believe in the adage of "slow to hire, quick to fire," but that doesn't give you carte blanche to drag out the process.

## Getting to know you 1 on 1

### After the 1:1

## Team interview

## Gut-check

## Making the decision

## Rejections & feedback

## Welcoming your new hire

## Summary

In Part 2, I'll go over the steps of my hiring process in detail, including communication, getting candidates to open up, facilitating a team interview, making the final decision, rejections, providing feedback, and getting your new hire ready and excited!
