Or, I Can See This Peak From My House.

# Hiking Long Scraggy

South of Buffalo Creek and just north of Deckers is Long Scraggy Peak. It's quite prominent, even from the metro area thanks to its eponymous peaks. I know I had seen it from Indian Creek area before, but it wasn't until my trip down to the Lost Creek wildy that I really took notice. I was driving down CR-67 as the sun rose through the crags. I really wish I had stopped for a photo, but I was running behind. Maybe next summer...

A while later, I hiked the CT segment and the Chair Rocks with Long Scraggy in the background, and the whole time I was wondering how to get up there. Checking Gaia, I didn't see any mapped trails, so I started to look around. Turns out, there's a well-established social trail and some AllTrails routes, along with some trip write-ups. [OutThere](https://www.outtherecolorado.com/features/long-scraggy-peak-lives-up-to-its-name-but-with-a-nice-payoff/article_441b5b6e-936f-518a-bfba-18be9cd9edf5.html) has a good one, along with [this one by KX0R.](http://www.schnizer.com/SOTAblog/sota-trip-report/w0cfr071-long-scraggy-peak-2681-8812-ft/)

This would be my first off-trail & unmarked hike, so I did a ton of planning and mapped out a loose route. There is some private land (a ranch) just west of the mountain which I wanted to be sure and avoid, and it was also the start of the 2nd deer/elk season so I wore a hi-vis just in case. I did hear plenty of gunshots, but they were fairly distant.

I got up there a bit late, maybe around 9:00, and made my way up the forest road. I turned off at the sign (about 2/3rds of a mile in) along the ridge, on singletrack. It's a pretty good trail with great visibility of the surrounding area, and it sure was windy...

The CT Seg 2 junction is super close. I recall passing this unmarked singletrack when I hiked Chair Rocks, and wondered if there were good campsites around here. Where _does_ one camp on this segment?

There's a short descent into the wooded area, then you end up right on the fenceline for the ranch. It's well-marked, so it's very easy to avoid.

There's a cadastral survey marker and old signage. The ranch owners carved a trail just to the north of the fenceline, which was a bit better to travel on the way in. On the way out, it was harder to follow and I overshot the turn-off by a few hundred feet.

Eventually, I got to the famed boardwalk and crossed over, where I didn't really see much in the way of trails, just a bunch of logs from the fuel mitigation activity. I found a good line up an old road (probably from the thinning) but I can't get the pictures from Gaia, so you'll just have to imagine it.

I found a forest marimo (moss ball) along the way.

There was no one living in the wildy tree. It was kinda surreal traveling off-trail for the first time, you have to constantly check your heading and compare the landscape to your map. I tried to avoid looking at Gaia too often and instead orient myself based on compass heading, knowing I would intersect the other forest road eventually.

I did eventually hit the FS road (not too far from the wildy tree) and made my way south towards the base. There's a turnoff into another logging area, and that's where the social trail begins. It's well-marked with white rock cairns and marking tape, and it's pretty easy to follow...navigation-wise, anyway. It was real steep.

Towards the top, I stopped to look out west. It was a gorgeous, windy day and super clear!

I didn't quite make it to the summit, but I got pretty close and stopped for a PB&J and snacks, sent some photos, and then headed down. I slipped and fell on the way down (re: steep) but it wasn't serious and I only bruised my hip a bit. Hiking back through the forest off-trail was easier than hiking in, and I felt much more confident. There's always a bit of nervousness & fear in the unknown, so it's good to push through it when you can.

I got back to the car around 2 and made my way home, worn out and feeling accomplished from the day's hike. I'm not sure if I'll hike Long Scraggy again anytime soon, but every time I see it in the distance I get a huge smile from knowing I've been on yet another peak I can see from my house!
